      Cameron Gary is a 27-year-old business man who enjoys stealing candy from
      babies, meditation and binge-watching netflix shows. He is giving and
      exciting, but can also be very boring and a bit evil. He is Egyptian. He
      finished school and then left academia. Physically, Cameron is not in
      great shape. He needs to lose quite a lot of weight. He is tall with olive
      skin, brown hair and black eyes. He has asymmetrical ears. He grew up in a
      working class neighbourhood. His parents separated when he was small, but
      remained friends and provided a happy, stable home. Cameron's best friend
      is an admin assistant called Lindsay Cox. They get on well most of the
      time. He also hangs around with Melissa Henderson and Abby Lynch. They
      enjoy yoga together.
