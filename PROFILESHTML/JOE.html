    <h2 class="text_archetype">
      Joe Cavalieri is a 32-year-old man who lives as a farmer. He was born in
      this same farm, and had to take control of business at the death of his
      father when he was 22. <br />
      <br />
      He enjoys working in nature, and is in love with every one of his animals.
      He grew up in a space where animals were always present, and that made him
      very conscious of their suffering and their welfare. He only produces bio
      products and doesn't produce meat.
