    <h2 class="text_archetype">
      Susan Thunder is a 42-year-old mother who enjoys walks in the mountain and
      spreading fake news on Facebook. She is generous and reliable, but can
      also be very sneaky and a bit impatient. She is British and she started
      studying sports science at college but never finished the course. She grew
      up in a middle class neighbourhood. Her parents separated when she was
      small.
      <br />
      <br />
      She is currently married to Kenneth Rafferty Glen. Kenneth is the same age
      as her and works as a plumber. Susan has two children with husband
      Kenneth: Lincoln aged 5 and Huxley aged 7. Susan's best friend is a
      semi-professional sports person called Mercer Bowman. They enjoy baking
      together.
